# Keylogger

This is a simple Python script that logs the keys pressed by the user and saves them to a file named "keyfile.txt". It utilizes the 'keyboard' module from the 'pynput' package to monitor and capture the key presses.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install pynput
Run the script using the following command:

shell
Copy code
python keylogger.py
The script will start monitoring for key presses and display the pressed keys on the console.

Press any keys you want to log. The script will log the keys to the "keyfile.txt" file in the current directory.

Press Enter to stop the script and exit.

Note
Please be aware that keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes. Make sure to comply with all applicable laws and obtain proper authorization before using or distributing such software.
